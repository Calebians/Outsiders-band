 In this piece, we are going to take a look at the memebers of Burna Boy's 
 <strong>The Outsiders band</strong> that has been making waves all over the globe 
 and also recently at the sold-out show at <strong>Madison Square Garden.</strong>

Do you know that the <strong>The Outsiders</strong>is the first musical band from Africa to perform at the MSG.
They are well known to be one of the best band to come out of Africa.
<br>
From this part of the world where the art of live music and the actualisation of music bands have been pushed
to the back of the industry, The Outsiders have come to not only rise above by making a name for 
themselves in the country, but also by trailblazing in their international performance. This supporting band 
to Burna Boy, <strong>"The African Giant"</strong> himself, has been together touring cities and countries all 
over the world and blowing minds with their coordinated vocals and electrifying instrumentalisation for more than half
a decade now. Despite sharing the spotlight with the Burna Boy, as he is always seen together with them, 
not much is known about the band members themselves. This piece is meant to rectify that, here we will take a look 
at the members of Burna Boy's famous <strong>The Outsiders band</strong> examining the very cogs that have served to
 propel the African Giant into one of the greatest African performers of all time.
 <br><br> Now, Meet the Outsiders;
 <br>
 <h4 class="sub-headings">The Drummer</h4>
 The man behind the master percussions of the band is Emmanuel Laj, he commands presence on the drum set to give unforgettable 
 drum instrumentalisation to Burna Boy on his global takeover. Laj has been on the road with Burna Boy and the band for 6 years.
 
<h4 class="sub-headings">Burna's Backup Vocalist</h4>
Burna Boy's background vocalist of more than 5 years is Christina Matovu, whose voice is the electrifying backup you often dance to at BurnaBoy's shows 
and even on records. The Ugandan-born gospel singer, Matovu leads the other vocalists that make up Burna Boyâ€™s set 
and has stolen the show a couple of times with her amazing vocals and dance moves.

<h4 class="sub-headings">The DJ</h4>
An important element to a great show is a DJ that has an understanding of his artiste brand and body language to be the master 
of the audio playback. While Burna Boy is well-known for his captivating live performances, the megastar 
undoubtedly needs a DJ to handle his playback while on tour and this is where Spaceship Billy comes in. You have to
appreciate Billy at what he does.

<h4>The Guitarist and Pianist</h4>
The guitar master on The Outsiders band is Otis B, he has been touring cities with Burna Boy for about 4 years now, swaying arenas and 
mesmerizing with his skills on the bass guitar and synthesizer.<br> 
The wheels to greatness can only turn to their destination when all the cogs are in motion and for Odogwu and his Outsiders band,
 an essential finish to the harmonious instrumentalisation we all hear is the piano, either as first or second keys, which is the backup. 
For this, Jolaade Aderibigbe has been the man for the job.<br>
